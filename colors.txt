Constructors:
rgb default
rgb numbers 
(rgb letters... very extra feature)
ryb color model
cmy color model



To create a Colour object you must specify exactly three colour components 
//constructor three arguments, diff models diff constructors
•It is not allowed to create a Colour object without specifying valid component values 
//arguments not null
•Valid component values are in the range 0 to 255 
// less than, more than
•The default colour model is RGB
//no string specified, use RGB constructor  
•A different colour models is specified by using a String value to identify the name of the model when creating the Colour object 
//fourth value in constructor, string
•Colours can be compared, to be equal they must have the same colour model and same component values 
//override isEqual, specs above clear- getters ==
•Colours can be added, if they use the same model, by adding each of the components, however the value of each component cannot exceed 255
//if same model (exc), try to add, throw exception too high number at >255- three times, so maybe that second exception from separate inner method


//**** create the interface for failing tests
